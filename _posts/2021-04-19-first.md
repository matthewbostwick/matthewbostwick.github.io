## A website

For years I've had matthewbostwick.com just point at my tumbler. In ten years I managed to post 4 times. I never really committed to keeping my website up to date. 

*This is about to change* 

Or at least that's my goal. 

At the beginning of 2021 I took on the mission of "Do something every day worth taking a picture of". I hope to bring deeper thoughts, projects, accomplishments, and updates to this venue. 

Stay tuned.
